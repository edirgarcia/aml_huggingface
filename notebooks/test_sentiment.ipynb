    "The other half is incredible detail to the period of this movie which takes place in 1969 Hollywood. DiCaprio plays a former western star who would like to get his career jump started again. \n",
    "I remember back in the 50s and early 60s television was saturated with westerns. DiCaprio is playing one of those stars and westerns had gone into a decline as public taste has changed. \n",
    "But there are a few being made still and DiCaprio is shooting an episode in Lancer. Back in the day Brad Pitt was his stunt double and now he's gotten older and heavier and he's a iconoclastic sort.and he's essentially DiCaprio's entourage.\n",
    " These two are so great together in every scene they're both in. As it turns out DiCaprio lives in a Beverly Hills cul-de-sac and his neighbors are Roman Polanski and his wife the ill fated Sharon Tate played her by Margot Robbie. \n",
    " There's this aura of tragedy that Tarantino creates around her and her friend hairstylist to the star Jay Sebring played by Emile Hirsch. For one who in her short career played some sexpots there's a sweet innocence in Robbie's portrayal of Tate.\n",
    "  Also note good performances by Al Pacino as a producer always on the cutting edge of new trends in the business. And Bruce Dern is unforgettable as George Spahn who owned the movie ranch property where many westerns were shot back in the day. \n",
